        <h3>BUY, SALE, RENT, TRANSFER, TENDER, OTHER ALL</h3>
        <P>1) Sole management You can do whatever you want with the property. Designs, plants, styles, colours – all these can be configured according to your preference. You also choose who to rent or sell your property to. a piece of it.</P>
        <P>2) Reduced volatility People see stocks as high-risk investments and it can bankrupt you if you’re not careful. This is one reason why people invest instead on properties as they’re less volatile compared to shares and similar options.
            <P>3) Added income Renting your property is one of the best ways to earn from your investment. Subtracting the tax and maintenance costs, you’ll still get a decent amount of income without doing anything much. Even if your mortgage costs $500
                and maintenance will cost you another $200, you still have money to pocket if you rent your property for a thousand dollars. </P>
            <P>4) Capital growth Purchasing property in a developing location is a decision that can make you rich. Areas with high business traffic will surely generate more profit than a property in a rural area. Newcastle, New Farm, Hobart, and Canberra
                are the hot places to invest in. Huge developments in the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast also signal a good time to buy properties in the area. </P>
            <P>5) Tax deductions Expenses on maintenance, counselling fees, and cost of hiring a managing agent can all be filed for tax deductions at the end of the year. Property value depreciation can also be considered in filing for tax write-offs. </P>
            <P>6) Tangible asset Having an asset that you can see and touch creates a comforting feeling that you’ve bought something solid and stable. Besides, there’s a limited supply of land while the demand for it continues to increase, so it’s advisable
                to grab</P>
